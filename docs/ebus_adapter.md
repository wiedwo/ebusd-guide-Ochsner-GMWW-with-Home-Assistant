# eBUS Adapter Shield v5

You need to wire the adapter with your heatpump via a eBUS two-wire cable.(You can take a usual KNX wire EIB Y-(ST)-Y 2x2x0,8 for that). 
You should also add a USR-ES1 Modul mit W5500 to connect your adapter with you network via ethernet cable.
For detailed instruction refer to [eBUS Adapter Shield v5 Ethernet](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v5/#ethernet).
Do not forget, you also need a normal USB-cable with Micro-B-plug.
