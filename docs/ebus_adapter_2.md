**How to wire the adapter with the heatpump ?**
- Shut down the heat pump to avoid electric problems
- Open the top cover of the heat pump
- Follow the 2-wire cable from the OCHSNER front control panel to the OTE adapter
- Connect your 2-wire cable in parallel with the OTE adapter connector in question
  (***Maybe 40, but CHECK CAREFULLY!***)
